Lighting

Immersion and Theme

I started to use torches to compliment the theme of a dungeon, I felt that it worked pretty effectively as the shadows really complimented the darkness in some areas.

In some of the areas, particularly the ceiling, I added just plain light objects instead of using torhces, as spamming them everywhere got old and I wanted it to show they lit up a bit more. I wanted the ceilings to be visible as well to show the players how high they are, instead of looking up at nothing. 

Guidance and Orientation

Some areas like mid, are lit almost fully to promote more players to move towards those areas to increase firefights. Also, I would leave some places dim, or more bright to show off important landmarks in the map.

As shown here, the area above the pillar is lit up less to slightly lead you towards a powerful rocket launcher.
