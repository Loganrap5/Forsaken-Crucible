## Pre Production

Originally the map was outlined with a drawn out map on paper.

This particular map was originally styled towards a bomb planting scenario map, but I quickly rechanged it into a Quake map. The idea was to have a centralized area with multiple entrances to it, making it a fast paced level. I started out with a simple blockout of the map, and had around 8 players test it and give feedback.
