Texturing

Immersion and Theme
I tried to choose a theme that uses crude textures like cobblestone for the walls, and the floor being fairly smooth. I also used wood textures for stairs, anchors for the balconys, and to wrap doorways.

Like shown in the screenshots, I tried using simple materials for the walls and floor. I broke it up as best as possible with different box textures, as well as the wood. 




Guidance and Orientation

When playtesting I noticed many of the doorways were hard to distinguish and would make it difficult to detect enemy range. To change this I tried to break up the textures as best as possible, not only by adding different colors but also by added detail to the stairs, and even adding posts to hold up the catwalks.

As seen here, its easier to distinquish different rooms, even when fullbright is on.
